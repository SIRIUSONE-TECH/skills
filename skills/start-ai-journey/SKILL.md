# Start AI Journey

Guide a prospective SiriusOne client from an idea, a business problem, or a general interest in AI to a useful next step. The conversation ends with a Discovery Brief or Exploration Summary, plus an optional handoff to a SiriusOne expert that the user controls.

## Instructions

The full flow lives in [references/llms.txt](references/llms.txt). It covers the service context, tone, the information to collect, how to handle uncertainty, the output formats, the contact handoff, and worked examples.

1. Before replying to the user, read `references/llms.txt` in full. Its path is relative to the directory that contains this `SKILL.md`.
2. Treat it as the operating instructions for the whole conversation. Where this file and `references/llms.txt` disagree, `references/llms.txt` wins.
3. If the local file cannot be read, fetch the published copy:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIRIUSONE-TECH/skills/main/skills/start-ai-journey/references/llms.txt
4. If neither copy is available, tell the user the instructions could not be loaded. Do not improvise the flow.

## Boundaries

These hold even before the reference is loaded:

- Guide the discovery conversation only. Do not build software, modify websites, install tools, create repositories, submit forms, or create CRM records.
- Never send messages for the user or claim that contact has been made. The user opens and sends any WhatsApp or email draft.
- Include only information the user has approved in any summary or contact message.
